# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## What you can do with the Bookapp:
Bookapp App

Bookapp is a simple React.js web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can perform advanced searches by filtering books by category (such as fiction) and explore additional features such as author and publisher filtering. The app provides detailed information about each book, including its release date, authors, publisher, and description. Users can also access additional functionalities, such as reading the book, accessing a sample, or rating and recommending the book.

## Features:
Search: Users can enter the name of a book to search for and retrieve relevant results from the Google Books API.

Advanced Filtering: Users can filter search results by category (e.g., fiction).

Detailed Book Information: Each search result displays detailed information about the book, including its release date, authors, publisher, and a description.

Additional Book Actions: Depending on the features available for each book, users can perform actions such as reading the full book, accessing a sample, or exploring more about the book on Google.

Rating and Recommendations: Users can rate books and add recommendations or comments to share their opinions with others.

## Usage
Search for a Book: Enter the name of the book you're looking for in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button.

Filter Search Results: Use the filter buttons to refine your search results based on categories like fiction, non-fiction, or by specific authors or publishers.

View Book Details: Click on a book to view detailed information, including its release date, authors, publisher, and description.

Access Additional Features: Depending on the book, you may have options to read the full book, access a sample, or explore more about the book on Google.

## Rate and Recommend: 
Share your thoughts about a book by rating it and adding recommendations or comments.

## Technologies Used:
React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Axios: HTTP client for making requests to the Google Books API.

Navigation: react-router-dom.

ICONS: @material-ui/core,FontAwesomeIcon and faStar.

Google Books API: External API used to search for and retrieve book information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
